Additionally, the word ""sportman"" should be ""athlete"" because an athlete is a more general term and can refer to someone who excels in any sport, while a sportsman typically refers to someone who participates in hunting or fishing.

First, the verb tense is incorrect. ""Did"" is in the past tense, but ""has to"" is in the present tense. This creates a tense disagreement in the sentence. 

Second, the phrase ""justified by law"" does not make sense in the context of legal behavior. A person does not need to be justified by law for behaving legally because legal behavior is already justified by law. It seems the intended meaning was for someone who behaved illegally to be justified by the law (i.e., given a fair trial and a chance to defend themselves).

The fixed sentence corrects both errors by changing the verb tense to ""behaved"" (past tense) and changing the phrase to ""be justified by law"" (passive voice, indicating someone else will be justifying them)."

","It features Diana Krall wearing a Rolex watch and the text suggests that if the reader wants to belong to a restricted club -- not necessarily of Rolex watch-wearers -- but of highly talented , sophisticated , competent artists , then he or she should also have a Rolex . ","There are a few things wrong with the original sentence:

1. ""It figures"" doesn't make sense in this context. It's not clear what the author means by this phrase.
2. The use of ""and"" between ""wearing a Rolex watch"" and ""has a text"" creates a run-on sentence. These two clauses should be separated into two sentences or connected with a coordinating conjunction (such as ""but"" or ""so"").
3. The phrase ""not necessarily of Rolex watch wearers"" is awkwardly placed and unclear. It's not clear what the author means by ""not necessarily,"" and the syntax of the sentence makes it difficult to understand who the restricted club is for.
4. The sentence could benefit from some additional punctuation, such as a comma after ""sophisticated"" and a colon after ""suggests.""

The fixed sentence resolves these issues by:

1. Replacing ""It figures"" with ""It features,"" which makes more sense in this context.
2. Separating the two clauses into two sentences.
3. Clarifying the meaning of the phrase ""not necessarily"" and adding hyphens to make the phrase ""Rolex watch-wearers"" clearer.

4641," Against those problems , people started to use cheaper transportation instead of car . ","Due to those problems , people started to utilize cheaper transportation methods instead of cars . ","There are a couple of issues with the original sentence. 

Firstly, the phrase ""against those problems"" isn't grammatically correct. It would be more appropriate to use ""due to"" or ""because of"" to indicate the reason for the change in transportation habits.

The fixed sentence addresses both of these issues by using ""due to"" to indicate the reason, and ""cars"" instead of ""car"" to accurately reflect the range of transportation options people might switch to.
